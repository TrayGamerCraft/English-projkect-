read this and answer the questions at the end:

[By the end of high school I’d
become a mogul. My tuck-shop
business had evolved into a miniempire that included selling pirated
CDs I made at home. I’d convinced
my mother, as frugal as she was,
that I needed a computer for school.
I didn’t. I wanted it so I could surf
the Internet and play Leisure Suit
Larry. But I was very convincing,
and she broke down and got it for
me. Thanks to the computer, the
Internet, and the fortunate gift of a
CD writer from a friend, I was in
business.
I had carved out my niche, and
was having a great time; life was so
good as an outsider that I didn’t
even think about dating. The only
girls in my life were the naked ones
on my computer. While I
downloaded music and messed
around in chat rooms, I’d dabble in
porn sites here and there. No video,
of course, only pictures. With
online porn today you just drop
straight into the madness, but with
dial-up it took so long for the
images to load. It was almost
gentlemanly compared to now.
You’d spend a good five minutes
looking at her face, getting to know
her as a person. Then a few minutes
later you’d get some boobs. By the
time you got to her vagina, you’d
spent a lot of quality time together.
In September of grade twelve,
the matric dance was coming up.
Senior prom. This was the big one. I
was again faced with the dilemma
of Valentine’s Day, confronting
another strange ritual I did not
understand. All I knew about prom
was that, according to my American
movies, prom is where it happens.
You lose your virginity. You go and
you ride in the limousine, and then
you and the girl do the thing. That
was literally my only reference. But
I knew the rule: Cool guys get girls,
and funny guys get to hang out with
the cool guys with their girls. So I’d
assumed I wouldn’t be going, or if I
did go it wouldn’t be with a date.
I had two middlemen working
for me in my CD business, Bongani
and Tom. They sold the CDs that I
copied in exchange for a cut. I met
Tom at the arcade at the Balfour
Park mall. Like Teddy, he lived
nearby because his mom was a
domestic worker. Tom was in my
grade but went to a government
school, Northview, a proper ghetto
school. Tom handled my CD sales
over there.
Tom was a chatterbox,
hyperactive and go-go-go. He was a
real hustler, too, always trying to
cut a deal, work an angle. He could
get people to do anything. A great
guy, but fucking crazy and a
complete liar as well. I went with
him once to Hammanskraal, a
settlement that was like a
homeland, but not really.
Hammanskraal, as its Afrikaans
name suggests, was the kraal of
Hamman, what used to be a white
man’s farm. The proper homelands,
Venda and Gazankulu and Transkei,
were places where black people
actually lived, and the government
drew a border around them and
said, “Stay there.” Hammanskraal
and settlements like it were empty
places on the map where deported
black people had been relocated.
That’s what the government did.
They would find some patch of arid,
dusty, useless land, and dig row
after row of holes in the ground—a
thousand latrines to serve four
thousand families. Then they’d
forcibly remove people from
illegally occupying some white area
and drop them off in the middle of
nowhere with some pallets of
plywood and corrugated iron. “Here.
This is your new home. Build some
houses. Good luck.” We’d watch it
on the news. It was like some
heartless, survival-based reality TV
show, only nobody won any money.
One afternoon in
Hammanskraal, Tom told me we
were going to see a talent show. At
the time, I had a pair of Timberland
boots I’d bought. They were the
only decent piece of clothing I
owned. Back then, almost no one in
South Africa had Timberlands. They
were impossible to get, but
everyone wanted them because
American rappers wore them. I’d
scrimped and saved my tuck-shop
money and my CD money to buy
them. As we were leaving, Tom told
me, “Be sure to wear your
Timberlands.”
The talent show was in this
little community hall attached to
nothing in the middle of nowhere.
When we got there, Tom was going
around, shaking hands, chatting
with everybody. There was singing,
dancing, some poetry. Then the
host got up onstage and said, “Re na
le modiragatsi yo o kgethegileng.
Ka kopo amogelang…Spliff Star!”
“We’ve got a special performer, a
rapper all the way from America.
Please welcome…Spliff Star!”
Spliff Star was Busta Rhymes’s
hype man at the time. I sat there,
confused. What? Spliff Star? In
Hammanskraal? Then everyone in
the room turned and looked at me.
Tom walked over and whispered in
my ear.
“Dude, come up onstage.”
“What?”
“Come onstage.”
“Dude, what are you talking
about?”
“Dude, please, you’re gonna get
me in so much shit. They’ve already
paid me the money.”
“Money? What money?”
Of course, what Tom had failed
to tell me was that he’d told these
people he was bringing a famous
rapper from America to come and
rap in their talent show. He had
demanded to be paid up front for
doing so, and I, in my Timberlands,
was that famous American rapper.
“Screw you,” I said. “I’m not
going anywhere.”
“Please, dude, I’m begging you.
Please do me this favor. Please.
There’s this girl here, and I wanna
get with her, and I told her I know
all these rappers…Please. I’m
begging you.”
“Dude, I’m not Spliff Star.
What am I gonna do?!”
“Just rap Busta Rhymes songs.”
“But I don’t know any of the
lyrics.”
“It doesn’t matter. These
people don’t speak English.”
“Aw, fuck.”
I got up onstage and Tom did
some terrible beat-boxing—“Bff badff, bff bff ba-dff”—while I
stumbled through some Busta
Rhymes lyrics that I made up as I
went along. The audience erupted
with cheers and applause. An
American rapper had come to
Hammanskraal, and it was the most
epic thing they had ever seen.
So that’s Tom.
One afternoon Tom came by
my house and we started talking
about the dance. I told him I didn’t
have a date, couldn’t get a date, and
wasn’t going to get a date.
“I can get you a girl to go with
you to the dance,” he said.
“No, you can’t.”
“Yes, I can. Let’s make a deal.”
“I don’t want one of your deals,
Tom.”
“No, listen, here’s the deal. If
you give me a better cut on the CDs
I’m selling, plus a bunch of free
music for myself, I’ll come back
with the most beautiful girl you’ve
ever seen in your life, and she’ll be
your date for the dance.”
“Okay, I’ll take that deal
because it’s never going to happen.”
“Do we have a deal?”
“We have a deal, but it’s not
going to happen.”
“But do we have a deal?”
“It’s a deal.”
“Okay, I’m going to find you a
date. She’s going to be the most
beautiful girl you’ve ever seen, and
you’re going to take her to the
matric dance and you’re going to be
a superstar.”
The dance was still two months
away. I promptly forgot about Tom
and his ridiculous deal. Then he
came over to my house one
afternoon and popped his head into
my room.
“I found the girl.”
“Really?”
“Yeah. You have to come and
meet her.”
I knew Tom was full of shit,
but the thing that makes a con man
successful is that he never gives you
nothing. He delivers just enough to
keep you believing. Tom had
introduced me to many beautiful
women. He was never dating them,
but he talked a good game, and was
always around them. So when he
said he had a girl, I didn’t doubt
him. The two of us jumped on a bus
and headed into the city.
The girl lived in a run-down
block of flats downtown. We found
her building, and a girl leaned over
the balcony and waved us inside.
That was the girl’s sister Lerato,
Tom said. Come to find out, he’d
been trying to get with Lerato, and
setting me up with the sister was
his way in—of course, Tom was
working an angle.
It was dark in the lobby. The
elevator was busted, so we walked
up several flights. This girl Lerato
brought us into the flat. In the
living room was this giant, but I
mean really, really enormous, fat
woman. I was like, Oh, Tom. I see
what you’ve done here. Nicely
played. Tom was a big joker as well.
“Is this my date?” I asked.
“No, no, no,” he said. “This is
not your date. This is her older
sister. Your date is Babiki. Babiki
has three older sisters, and Lerato is
her younger sister. Babiki’s gone to
the store to buy groceries. She’ll be
back in a moment.”
We waited, chatted with the
older sister. Ten minutes later the
door opened and the most beautiful
girl I have ever seen in my life
walked in. She was…good Lord.
Beautiful eyes, beautiful golden
yellow-brown skin. It was like she
glowed. No girl at my high school
looked anything like her.
“Hi,” she said.
“Hi,” I replied.
I was dumbfounded. I had no
idea how to talk to a girl that
beautiful. She was shy and didn’t
speak much, either. There was a bit
of an awkward pause. Luckily Tom’s
a guy who just talks and talks. He
jumped right in and smoothed
everything over. “Trevor, this is
Babiki. Babiki, Trevor.” He went on
and on about how great I was, how
much she was looking forward to
the dance, when I would pick her up
for the dance, all the details. We
hung out for a few, and then Tom
needed to get going so we headed
out the door. Babiki turned and
smiled at me and waved as we left.
“Bye.”
“Bye.”
We walked out of that building
and I was the happiest man on
earth. I couldn’t believe it. I was the
guy at school who couldn’t get a
date. I’d resigned myself to never
getting a date, didn’t consider
myself worthy of having a date. But
now I was going to the matric dance
with the most beautiful girl in the
world.
Over the following weeks we
went down to Hillbrow a few more
times to hang out with Babiki and
her sisters and her friends. Babiki’s
family was Pedi, one of South
Africa’s smaller tribes. I liked
getting to know people of different
backgrounds, so that was fun.
Babiki and her friends were what
we call amabhujua. They’re as poor
as most other black people, but they
try to act like they’re not. They
dress fashionably and act rich.
Amabhujua will put a shirt on
layaway, one shirt, and spend seven
months paying it off. They’ll live in
shacks wearing Italian leather
shoes that cost thousands. An
interesting crowd.
Babiki and I never went on a
date alone. It was always the two of
us in a group. She was shy, and I
was a nervous wreck most of the
time, but we had fun. Tom kept
everyone loose and having a good
time. Whenever we’d say goodbye,
Babiki would give me a hug, and
once she even gave me a little kiss. I
was in heaven. I was like, Yeah, I’ve
got a girlfriend. Cool.
—
As the dance approached, I started
getting nervous. I didn’t have a car.
I didn’t have any decent clothes.
This was my first time taking out a
beautiful girl, and I wanted it to be
perfect.
We’d moved to Highlands
North when my stepfather’s garage
went out of business, and he moved
his workshop to the house. We had
a big yard and a garage in the back,
and that became his new workshop,
essentially. At any given time, we
had at least ten or fifteen cars in the
driveway, in the yard, and out on
the street, clients’ cars being
worked on and old junkers Abel
kept around to tinker with. One
afternoon Tom and I were at the
house. Tom was telling Abel about
my date, and Abel decided to be
generous. He said I could take a car
for the dance.
There was a red Mazda that
we’d had for a while, a complete
piece of shit but it worked well
enough. I’d borrowed it before, but
the car I really wanted was Abel’s
BMW. It was old and beat-up like
the Mazda, but a shit BMW is still a
BMW. I begged him to let me take
it.
“Please, please, can I use the
BMW?”
“Not a fucking chance.”
“Please. This is the greatest
moment in my life. Please. I’m
begging you.”
“No.”
“Please.”
“No. You can take the Mazda.”
Tom, always the hustler and
the dealmaker, stepped in.
“Bra Abie,” he said. “I don’t
think you understand. If you saw
the girl Trevor is taking to the
dance, you would see why this is so
important. Let’s make a deal. If we
bring her here and she’s the most
beautiful girl you’ve ever seen in
your life, you’ll let him take the
BMW.”
Abel thought about it.
“Okay. Deal.”
We went to Babiki’s flat, told
her my parents wanted to meet her,
and brought her back to my house.
Then we brought her around to the
garage in the back where Abel and
his guys were working. Tom and I
went over and introduced them.
“Abel, this is Babiki. Babiki,
this is Abel.”
Abel smiled big, was charming
as always.
“Nice to meet you,” he said.
They chatted for a few minutes.
Tom and Babiki left. Abel turned to
me.
“Is that the girl?”
“Yes.”
“You can take the BMW.”
Once I had the car, I
desperately needed something to
wear. I was taking out this girl who
was really into fashion, and, except
for my Timberlands, everything I
owned was shit. I was limited in my
wardrobe choices because I was
stuck buying in the shops my
mother let me go to, and my mother
did not believe in spending money
on clothes. She’d take me to some
bargain clothing store and tell me
what our budget was, and I’d have
to find something to wear.
At the time I had no clue about
clothes. My idea of fashion was a
brand of clothing called
Powerhouse. It was the kind of stuff
weight lifters wear down in Miami
or out at Venice Beach, baggy track
pants with baggy sweatshirts. The
logo was a cartoon of this giant
bodybuilding bulldog wearing
wraparound sunglasses and
smoking a cigar and flexing his
muscles. On the pants he was
flexing all the way down your leg.
On the shirt he was flexing across
your chest. On the underwear, he
was flexing on your crotch. I
thought Powerhouse was the
baddest thing in the world, I can’t
even front. I had no friends, I loved
dogs, and muscles were cool—that’s
where I was working from. I had
Powerhouse everything, the full
range, five of the same outfit in five
different colors. It was easy. The
pants came with the top, so I knew
how to make it work.
Bongani, the other middleman
from my CD business, found out I
had a date, and he made it his
mission to give me a makeover.
“You need to up your game,” he
said. “You cannot go to the dance
looking the way you look—for her
sake, not yours. Let’s go shopping.”
I went to my mom and begged
her to give me money to buy
something to wear for the dance.
She finally relented and gave me
2,000 rand, for one outfit. It was
the most money she’d ever given
me for anything in my life. I told
Bongani how much I had to spend,
and he said we’d make it work. The
trick to looking rich, he told me, is
to have one expensive item, and for
the rest of the things you get basic,
good-looking quality stuff. The nice
item will draw everyone’s eye, and
it’ll look like you’ve spent more
than you have.
In my mind nothing was cooler
than the leather coats everybody
wore in The Matrix. The Matrix
came out while I was in high school
and it was my favorite movie at the
time. I loved Neo. In my heart I
knew: I am Neo. He’s a nerd. He’s
useless at everything, but secretly
he’s a badass superhero. All I
needed was a bald, mysterious black
man to come into my life and show
me the way. Now I had Bongani,
black, head shaved, telling me, “You
can do it. You’re the one.” And I was
like, “Yes. I knew it.”
I told Bongani I wanted a
leather coat like Keanu Reeves
wore, the ankle-length black one.
Bongani shut that down. “No, that’s
not practical. It’s cool, but you’ll
never be able to wear it again.” He
took me shopping and we bought a
calf-length black leather jacket,
which would look ridiculous today
but at the time, thanks to Neo, was
very cool. That alone cost 1,200
rand. Then we finished the outfit
with a pair of simple black pants,
suede square-toed shoes, and a
cream-white knitted sweater.
Once we had the outfit,
Bongani took a long look at my
enormous Afro. I was forever trying
to get the perfect 1970s Michael
Jackson Afro. What I had was more
Buckwheat: unruly and impossible
to comb, like stabbing a pitchfork
into a bed of crabgrass.
“We need to fix that fucking
hair,” Bongani said.
“What do you mean?” I said.
“This is just my hair.”
“No, we have to do something.”
Bongani lived in Alexandra. He
dragged me there, and we went to
talk to some girls from his street
who were hanging out on the
corner.
“What would you do with this
guy’s hair?” he asked them.
The girls looked me over.
“He has so much,” one of them
said. “Why doesn’t he cornrow it?”
“Shit, yeah,” they said. “That’s
great!”
I said, “What? Cornrows? No!”
“No, no,” they said. “Do it.”
Bongani dragged me to a hair
salon down the street. We went in
and sat down. The woman touched
my hair, shook her head, and
turned to Bongani.
“I can’t work with this sheep,”
she said. “You have to do something
about this.”
“What do we need to do?”
“You have to relax it. I don’t do
that here.”
“Okay.”
Bongani dragged me to a
second salon. I sat down in the
chair, and the woman took my hair
and started painting this creamy
white stuff in it. She was wearing
rubber gloves to keep this chemical
relaxer off her own skin, which
should have been my first clue that
maybe this wasn’t such a great idea.
Once my hair was full of the
relaxer, she told me, “You have to
try to keep it in for as long as
possible. It’s going to start burning.
When it starts burning, tell me and
we’ll rinse it out. But the longer you
can handle it, the straighter your
hair will become.”
I wanted to do it right, so I sat
in the chair and waited and waited
for as long as I could.
I waited too long.
She’d told me to tell her when
it started burning. She should have
told me to tell her when it started
tingling, because by the time it was
actually burning it had already
taken off several layers of my scalp.
I was well past tingling when I
started to freak out. “It’s burning!
It’s burning!” She rushed me over
to the sink and started to rinse the
relaxer out. What I didn’t know is
that the chemical doesn’t really
start to burn until it’s being rinsed
out. I felt like someone was pouring
liquid fire onto my head. When she
was done I had patches of acid
burns all over my scalp.
I was the only man in the
salon; it was all women. It was a
window into what women
experience to look good on a regular
basis. Why would they ever do
this?, I thought. This is horrible.
But it worked. My hair was
completely straight. The woman
combed it back, and I looked like a
pimp, a pimp named Slickback.
Bongani then dragged me back
to the first salon, and the woman
agreed to cornrow my hair. She
worked slowly. It took six hours.
Finally she said, “Okay, you can
look in the mirror.” She turned me
around in the chair and I looked in
the mirror and…I had never seen
myself like that before. It was like
the makeover scenes in my
American movies, where they take
the dorky guy or girl, fix the hair
and change the clothes, and the
ugly duckling becomes the swan. I’d
been so convinced I’d never get a
date that I never tried to look nice
for a girl, so I didn’t know that I
could. The hair was good. My skin
wasn’t perfect, but it was getting
better; the pustules had receded
into regular pimples. I looked…not
bad.
I went home, and my mom
squealed when I walked in the door.
“Ooooooh! They turned my
baby boy into a pretty little girl! I’ve
got a little girl! You’re so pretty!”
“Mom! C’mon. Stop it.”
“Is this the way you’re telling
me that you’re gay?”
“What? No. Why would you say
that?”
“You know it’s okay if you are.”
“No, Mom. I’m not gay.”
Everyone in my family loved it.
They all thought it looked great. My
mom did tease the shit out of me,
though.
“It’s very well done,” she said,
“but it is way too pretty. You do
look like a girl.”
—
The big night finally came. Tom
came over to help me get ready. The
hair, the clothes, everything came
together perfectly. Once I was set,
we went to Abel to get the keys to
the BMW, and that was the
moment the whole night started to
go wrong.
It was a Saturday night, end of
the week, which meant Abel was
drinking with his workers. I walked
out to his garage, and as soon as I
saw his eyes I knew: He was
wasted. Fuck. When Abel was drunk
he was a completely different
person.
“Ah, you look nice!” he said
with a big smile, looking me over.
“Where are you going?”
“Where am I—Abie, I’m going
to the dance.”
“Okay. Have fun.”
“Um…can I get the keys?”
“The keys to what?”
“To the car.”
“What car?”
“The BMW. You promised I
could drive the BMW to the dance.”
“First go buy me some beers,”
he said.
He gave me his car keys; Tom
and I drove to the liquor store. I
bought Abel a few cases of beer,
drove back, and unloaded it for him.
“Okay,” I said, “can I take the
BMW now?”
“No.”
“What do you mean ‘no’?”
“I mean ‘no.’ I need my car
tonight.”
“But you promised. You said I
could take it.”
“Yeah, but I need the car.”
I was crushed. I sat there with
Tom and begged him for close to
half an hour.
“Please.”
“No.”
“Please.”
“Nope.”
Finally we realized it wasn’t
going to happen. We took the shitty
Mazda and drove to Babiki’s house.
I was an hour late picking her up.
She was completely pissed off. Tom
had to go in and convince her to
come out, and eventually she did.
She was even more gorgeous
than before, in an amazing red
dress, but she was clearly not in a
great mood. Inside I was quietly
starting to panic, but I smiled and
kept trying my gentlemanly best to
be a good date, holding the door for
her, telling her how beautiful she
was. Tom and the sister gave us a
send-off and we headed out.
Then I got lost. The dance was
being held at some venue in a part
of town I wasn’t familiar with, and
at some point I got completely
turned around and had no idea
where I was. I drove around for an
hour in the dark, going left, going
right, doubling back. I was on my
cellphone the whole time,
desperately calling people, trying to
figure out where I was, trying to get
directions. Babiki sat next to me in
stony silence the whole time,
clearly not feeling me or this night
at all. I was crashing hard. I was
late. I didn’t know where I was
going. I was the worst date she’d
ever had in her life.
I finally figured out where I
was and we made it to the dance,
nearly two hours late. I parked,
jumped out, and ran around to get
her door. When I opened it, she just
sat there.
“Are you ready?” I said. “Let’s
go in.”
“No.”
“No? What…what do you mean,
‘no’?”
“No.”
“Okay…but why?”
“No.”
“But we need to go inside. The
dance is inside.”
“No.”
I stood there for another
twenty minutes, trying to convince
her to come inside, but she kept
saying “no.” She wouldn’t get out of
the car.
Finally, I said, “Okay, I’ll be
right back.”
I ran inside and found Bongani.
“Where have you been?” he
said.
“I’m here! But my date’s in the
car and she won’t come in.”
“What do you mean she won’t
come in?”
“I don’t know what’s going on.
Please help me.”
We went back out to the
parking lot. I took Bongani over to
the car, and the second he saw her
he lost it. “Jesus in Heaven! This is
the most beautiful woman I’ve ever
seen. You said she was beautiful,
Trevor, but this is insane.” In an
instant he completely forgot about
helping me with Babiki. He turned
and ran back inside and called to
the guys. “Guys! You gotta come see
this! Trevor got a date! And she’s
beautiful! Guys! Come out here!”
Twenty guys came running out
into the parking lot. They clustered
around the car. “Yo, she’s so hot!”
“Dude, this girl came with Trevor?”
Guys were gawking at her like she
was an animal at the zoo. They were
asking to take pictures with her.
They were calling back to more
people inside. “This is insane! Look
at Trevor’s date! No, no, no, you
gotta come and see!”
I was mortified. I’d spent four
years of high school carefully
avoiding any kind of romantic
humiliation whatsoever, and now,
on the night of the matric dance,
the night of all nights, my
humiliation had turned into a circus
bigger than the event itself: Trevor
the undatable clown thought he was
going to have the most beautiful
girl at the dance, but he’s crashing
and burning so let’s all go outside
and watch.
Babiki sat in the passenger
seat, staring straight ahead,
refusing to budge. I was outside the
car, pacing, stressed out. A friend of
mine had a bottle of brandy that
he’d smuggled into the dance.
“Here,” he said, “have some of this.”
Nothing mattered at that point, so I
started drinking. I’d fucked up. The
girl didn’t like me. The night was
done.
Most of the guys eventually
wandered back inside. I was sitting
on the pavement, taking swigs from
the brandy bottle, getting buzzed. At
some point Bongani went back over
to the car to try one last time to
convince Babiki to come in. After a
minute his head popped up over the
car with this confused look.
“Yo, Trevor,” he said, “your date
does not speak English.”
“What?”
“Your date. She does not speak
any English.”
“That’s not possible.”
I got up and walked over to the
car. I asked her a question in
English and she gave me a blank
stare.
Bongani looked at me.
“How did you not know that
your date does not speak English?”
“I…I don’t know.”
“Have you never spoken to
her?”
“Of course I have—or,
wait…have I?”
I started flashing back through
all the times I’d been with Babiki,
meeting at her flat, hanging out
with her friends, introducing her to
Abel. Did I talk to her then? No. Did
I talk to her then? No. It was like
the scene in Fight Club where Ed
Norton’s character flashes back and
realizes he and Brad Pitt have never
been in the same room with Helena
Bonham Carter at the same time.
He realizes he’s been punching
himself the whole time. He’s Tyler
Durden. In all the excitement of
meeting Babiki, the times we were
hanging out and getting to know
each other, we were never actually
speaking to each other. It was
always through Tom.
Fucking Tom.
Tom had promised he’d get me
a beautiful date for the dance, but
he hadn’t made any promises about
any of her other qualities.
Whenever we were together, she
was speaking Pedi to Tom, and Tom
was speaking English to me. But
she didn’t speak English, and I
didn’t speak Pedi. Abel spoke Pedi.
He’d learned several South African
languages in order to deal with his
customers, so he’d spoken with her
fluently when they met. But in that
moment I realized I’d never actually
heard her say anything in English
other than: “Yes.” “No.” “Hi.” “Bye.”
That’s it: “Yes.” “No.” “Hi.” “Bye.”
Babiki was so shy that she
didn’t talk much to begin with, and
I was so inept with women that I
didn’t know how to talk to her. I’d
never had a girlfriend; I didn’t even
know what “girlfriend” meant.
Someone put a beautiful woman on
my arm and said, “She’s your
girlfriend.” I’d been mesmerized by
her beauty and just the idea of her—
I didn’t know I was supposed to talk
to her. The naked women on my
computer, I’d never had to talk to
them, ask them their opinions, ask
them about their feelings. And I
was afraid I’d open my mouth and
ruin the whole thing, so I just
nodded and smiled along and let
Tom do the talking.
All three of Babiki’s older
sisters spoke English, and her
younger sister Lerato spoke a little.
So whenever we hung out with
Babiki and her sisters and their
friends, a lot of the conversation
was in English. The rest of it was
going right by me in Pedi or in
Sotho, but that’s completely normal
in South Africa so it never bothered
me; I got enough of the gist of the
conversation from everyone’s
English to know what was going on.
And the way my mind works with
language, even when I’m hearing
other languages, they get filtered
into English as I’m hearing them.
My mind stores them in English.
When my grandmother and greatgrandmother were hysterically
praying to God to destroy the
demon that had shit on their
kitchen floor, all of that transpired
in Xhosa, but it’s stored in English.
I remember it as English. So
whenever I lay in bed at night
dreaming about Babiki and the
moments we’d spent together, I felt
like it had transpired in English
because that’s how I remembered
it. And Tom had never said anything
about what language she spoke or
didn’t speak, because why would he
care? He just wanted to get his free
CDs and get with the sister. Which
is how I’d been dating a girl for over
a month—the girl I very much
believed was my first girlfriend—
without ever having had a single
conversation with her.
Now the whole night came
rushing back and I saw it from her
point of view, and it was perfectly
obvious to me why she didn’t want
to get out of the car. She probably
hadn’t wanted to go to the dance
with me in the first place; she
probably owed Tom a favor, and
Tom can talk anyone into anything.
Then I’d left her sitting and waiting
for me for an hour and she was
pissed off. Then she got into the car
and it was the first time we had ever
been alone, and she realized I
couldn’t even hold a conversation
with her. I’d driven her around and
gotten lost in the dark—a young girl
alone in a car in the middle of
nowhere with some strange guy, no
idea where I was taking her. She
was probably terrified. Then we got
to the dance and she didn’t speak
anyone’s language. She didn’t know
anyone. She didn’t even know me.
Bongani and I stood outside
the car, staring at each other. I
didn’t know what to do. I tried
talking to her in every language I
knew. Nothing worked. She only
spoke Pedi. I got so desperate that I
started trying to talk to her using
hand signals.
“Please. You. Me. Inside.
Dance. Yes?”
“No.”
“Inside. Dance. Please?”
“No.”
I asked Bongani if he spoke
Pedi. He didn’t. I ran inside to the
dance and ran around looking for
someone who spoke Pedi to help
me to convince her to come in. “Do
you speak Pedi? Do you speak Pedi?
Do you speak Pedi?” Nobody spoke
Pedi.
So I never got to go to my
matric dance. Other than the three
minutes I spent running through it
looking for someone who spoke
Pedi, I spent the whole night in the
parking lot. When the dance ended,
I climbed back into the shitty red
Mazda and drove Babiki home. We
sat in total awkward silence the
whole way.
I pulled up in front of her block
of flats in Hillbrow, stopped the car,
and sat for a moment as I tried to
figure out the polite and
gentlemanly way to end the
evening. Then, out of nowhere, she
leaned over and gave me a kiss.
Like, a real kiss, a proper kiss. The
kind of kiss that made me forget
that the whole disaster had just
happened. I was so confused. I
didn’t know what I was supposed to
do. She pulled back and I looked
deep into her eyes and thought, I
have no idea how girls work.
I got out of the car, walked
around to her side, and opened her
door. She gathered up her dress and
stepped out and headed toward her
flat, and as she turned to go I gave
her one last little wave.
“Bye.”
“Bye.”]
